Quote %QUOTE% *!* %CUST%

The variables are between % signs.  The * ! * separates the subject from the body.  This section here is where you would type your default order confirmation text.
go edit the file GLOBAL\CUSTOM\6930\CCC\Templates\quote.txt (where CCC is the company code) so it displays your standard acknowledgement text


Also edit the file GLOBAL\CUSTOM\6930\CCC\Templates\example sig.txt and SAVE AS your user ID.txt (do this for each user that needs a signature)
%SIG%
